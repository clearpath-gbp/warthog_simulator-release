ros-kinetic-warthog-gazebo (0.1.1-1xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Add yaw to the arguments for spawn_warthog
  * Moved spawning into a specific launch, so this is more portable to other packages
  * Include the same playpen world that we use with the Moose & use it as the warthog_world's map.  Add additional launch files for the race world & empty world
  * Contributors: Chris I-B, Chris Iverach-Brereton, Dave Niewinski
